    <p>People often think that Trading is gambling, and traders who are successful are
        just
        lucky. This thought is completely wrong.</p>
    <p>In reality, successful traders are <strong>Disciplined to their Rules, well
        Informed,
        Emotionally stable, and mainly Robust</strong>. They always stick on rules and
        updated with the market status. In simple, all of these is nothing but Trading
        Psychology.</p>

    <p>Psychology is all about the stuff that goes on in our minds and hearts,
        influencing
        how we act in different situations.</p>
    <p>When we talk about trading psychology, it's about those smart brainy things that
        impact how traders make decisions.</p>
    <p>In easy words, trading psychology is about understanding the thoughts, feelings,
        and
        emotions that come up to traders while trading are taking position. It's like
        knowing what's going on inside their heads while they're busy with their
        trades.</p>

    <div class="entry__item_excerpt">Lets understand by a simple Scenario, in which more than
        90%
        traders will suffer even after they are trading from long back.
    </div>
    <p>Meet Alex, our aspiring trader who's been putting in the effort to learn technical
        analysis
        and develop a trading strategy. After few days finally he decided to trade on live
        market.</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Paper Trading:</strong>
            <p>Before going live, Alex practiced in a paper trading account with virtual money.
                When
                he made the trade in paper trading, he faced ups and downs in the market.</p>
            <p>But, he stayed cool as a cucumber. Since it wasn't real money, he wasn't stressed
                about losing anything.</p>
            <p>Alex had set a stop-loss level beforehand, and he decided to stick to his plan.
                As
                the trade started to turn around, he kept him cool and didn't let emotions get
                in
                the way.</p> Eventually, he closed the trade with a nice profit, just as his
            analysis suggested!<p></p></li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Live Trading:</strong>
            <p>When Alex finally decided to try live trading, he was super excited! He entered a
                trade based on his technical analysis, but once the trade was live, he got
                really
                nervous.</p>
            <p>Every little price move made him worry about losing money. Market hits stop-loss
                moved up again, and in a moment of panic he brought again and closed the trade
                prematurely, and unfortunately, it resulted in a loss.</p>
            <p>To recover the loss, he did multiple trades and finally he lost everything. And
                starts blaming others because of his loss</p></li>
    </ul>

<div class="container entry__item speech">
    <p>It seems like I am telling your story right? But you know what? This is something all
        traders
        experience. We're all human, and sometimes we get panic and struggle to stay emotionally
        stable and control our feelings when we are trading.</p></div>

                            break for a few days. Give yourself some time to cool off and get
                            back
                            in the right mindset.

                            Everyone's

                            with.

            <h3>Greed</h3>
            <div class="imgs">
                <img src="file:///android_asset/TradingPsychology/img4.webp">
            </div>
            <p>Most people jump into the stock market with the goal of making money, and that's
                totally fine! But sometimes, traders set their expectations way too high and
                expect
                quick riches.</p>
            <p>Trading is a profession just like any other, and it requires focus, dedication,
                and
                hard work. It takes time to build success, just like any career path.</p>
            <p>For instance, making $1000 from a trade with $100,000 capital yields 1% returns
                in a
                day. Repeating this success for a month brings over 20% returns. Consistency can
                double the capital in 5-6 months</p>
            <p>But here's the catch - many traders don't think about the percentage returns on
                their
                capital. So they end up taking big risks or making unnecessary trades, and
                sadly,
                they end up losing a big chunk of their capital.</p>
            <p>Remember, it's crucial to protect your <strong>capital</strong> because without
                it,
                you can't survive in the market. And, of course, making consistent profits is
                the
                key to success.</p>
            <p>So, if you're beginner, don't rush into the market thinking you'll get rich
                overnight. Take your time, learn the ropes, and be patient.</p>

            <h3>Fear</h3>
            <div class="imgs">

            </div>
            <p>You know, many of our fears come from past bad experiences in trading. Like when
                you're all set to take a breakout trade, but there's this hesitation in your
                mind.
                It might be because you've lost money with Fake-outs before, and now your brain
                links them to pain, making you afraid to try again.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, fear can also come from how we were brought up. If you grew up
                thinking
                that business is a bad thing, that belief might hold you back in your trading
                journey.</p>
            <p>But don't worry, there's a way to overcome these fears! The key is to boost your
                confidence in trading. You can do this by backtesting your system with more
                data,
                reading books about trading, or taking a trading course that fits your
                needs.</p>
            <p>And if you have fears related to your upbringing, it's crucial to identify and
                acknowledge them. Then you can use simple techniques like affirmations or
                practicing
                gratitude to work through them.</p>
            <p>Remember, you're not alone in facing fears in trading. With a little effort and
                support, you can tackle them head-on and become a more fearless and successful
                trader!</p>

            <h3>Regret</h3>
            <div class="imgs">

            </div>
            <p>Imagine you close a trade, but the price keeps going up, and you start thinking,
                "Oh
                no, I should have stayed in!" Or, you hold onto a trade, hoping for even more
                profits, but it turns against you, and you think, "I should have taken my
                profits
                when I had the chance!"</p>
            <p>But here's the thing - regretting decisions won't get us anywhere. The key is to
                plan
                your trades carefully and stick to your plan. Remember, it's impossible to catch
                every single great move in the market.</p>
            <p>Instead of dwelling on regrets, focus on learning and improving. Take it one day
                and
                one trade at a time. Every trade is an opportunity to grow and get better at
                this
                game.</p>
            <p>So, be kind to yourself, accept that not every trade will be perfect, and keep
                moving
                forward. Learn from your experiences, stay disciplined, and keep honing your
                trading
                skills. With time and practice, you'll become a more confident and successful
                trader! </p>

            <h3>Hope</h3>
            <div class="imgs">
                <img src="file:///android_asset/TradingPsychology/img7.webp">
            </div>
            <p>Let's talk about hope in trading - it's something we all experience, but it can sometimes lead us down the wrong path.</p>
            <p>Imagine a trader who has a solid plan for buying a stock at 200, setting a stop loss at 198, and booking profits at 204. So far, so good!</p>
            <p>The price reaches 200, and he's in the trade - awesome! But then, it moves to 204, and instead of booking his profits as planned, he starts hoping for more. He thinks, "Hey, maybe there will be a short covering rally, and I'll make even bigger profits!"</p>
            <p>But you know what happens next - the market takes a U-turn, and the stock price
                drops
                back to 199. Now, he hopes for a rebound, thinking, "It'll bounce back any
                moment
                now!"</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, it keeps going down, below his stop loss level of 198. But he's
                still
                hoping for a turnaround, even when the price hits 196.</p>
            <p>In this example, what happened? He lost control of his trading plan. When we
                deviate
                from our pre-planned stop loss and target, we're no longer in control. We start
                making decisions based on hope, which can weaken our trading strategy.</p>
            <p>So, always be prepared with clear action points - your stop loss and target.
                Stick to
                your trade plan and act accordingly. The market presents plenty of
                opportunities, so
                don't get stuck hoping for one trade to turn around miraculously.</p>
            <p>Remember, hope is great, but when it comes to trading, relying on it can lead to
                trouble. Stay disciplined and true to your plan, and you'll be on the path to
                more
                successful trades!</p>

    <br>

        <h3 class="list_title">1. What's cryptocurrency trading?</h3>
        <p>Cryptocurrency trading is the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies on an exchange. With
            us, you can trade cryptos by speculating on their price movements via CFDs (contracts
            for difference).</p>
        <p>CFDs are leveraged derivatives – meaning that you can trade cryptocurrency price
            movements without taking ownership of any underlying coins. When trading derivatives,
            you can go long (‘buy’) if you think a cryptocurrency will rise in value, or go short
            (‘sell’) if you think it will fall.</p>
        <p>By contrast, when you buy cryptocurrencies on an exchange, you buy the coins themselves.
            You’ll need to create an exchange account, put up the full value of the asset to open a
            position, and store the cryptocurrency tokens in your own wallet until you’re ready to
            sell.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="heading">How do cryptocurrency markets work?</h4>
        <p>The cryptocurrency market is a decentralised digital currency network, which means
            that it operates through a system of peer-to-peer transaction checks, rather than a
            central server. When cryptocurrencies are bought and sold, the transactions are
            added to the blockchain – a shared digital ledger that records data – through a
            process called ‘mining’.</p>

        </div>
        <h4 class="heading">What moves cryptocurrency markets?</h4>
        <p>Cryptocurrency markets move according to supply and demand. However, as they’re
            decentralised, they tend to remain free from many of the economic and political
            concerns that affect traditional currencies. While there is still a lot of
            uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, the following factors can have a
            significant impact on their prices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supply:</strong> the total number of coins and the rate at which they’re
                released, destroyed or lost
            </li>
            <li><strong>Market capitalisation:</strong> the value of all the coins in existence
                and how users perceive this to be developing
            </li>
            <li><strong>Press:</strong> the way the cryptocurrency is portrayed in the media and
                how much coverage it is getting
            </li>
            <li><strong>Integration:</strong> the extent to which the cryptocurrency easily
                integrates into existing infrastructure such as e-commerce payment systems
            </li>
            <li><strong>Key events: </strong>major events such as regulatory updates, security
                breaches and economic setbacks
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h3 class="list_title">2. Learn why people trade cryptocurrencies</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. For traders using leveraged derivatives
                that allow for both long and short positions, large and sudden price movements
                present opportunities for profit. However, at the same time, these also increase
                your exposure to risk. In short, the more volatile the market, the more risk you
                carry when trading it.</p>
            <p>With IG, you can trade cryptocurrencies via a CFD account – derivative products that
                enable you to speculate on whether your chosen cryptocurrency will rise or fall in
                value. Prices are quoted in traditional
                currencies such as the US dollar, and you never take ownership of the cryptocurrency
                itself. CFDs are a leveraged product, which means you can open a position for just a
                fraction of the full value of the trade. Although leveraged products can magnify
                your profits, they can also magnify losses if the market moves against you.</p>
            <p>When trading cryptocurrencies with us, you can:</p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access real-time pricing.</strong> We derive our prices from several
                    exchanges, and they’re calculated on a continuous basis
                </li>
                <li><strong>Get prices reflective of the underlying market.</strong> Because our
                    prices are based on real markets, in real time, they always reflect actual
                    market sentiment
                </li>
                <li><strong>Trade with derivatives.</strong> With our CFD account, you’ll never own
                    actual cryptocurrencies. This means you get to trade without opening an exchange
                    account or creating a wallet
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hedge against adverse markets.</strong> As CFDs enable you to take short
                    positions, you can hedge against losses on investments you already hold
                </li>
                <li><strong>Obtain low spreads.</strong> We work to keep our spreads amongst the
                    lowest in the market
                </li>
                <li><strong>Use continuous charting. </strong>Our award-winning platform<sup>1</sup>
                    offers cutting-edge HTML 5 charts and a selection of advanced indicators and
                    drawing tools
                </li>
                <li><strong>Enter and exit positions quickly.</strong> Owing to tight spreads and
                    our fast execution, CFDs enable you to enter and exit trades quickly
                </li>
                <li><strong>Trade on leverage and margin.</strong> CFDs are leveraged, giving you
                    full market exposure at a fraction of the initial outlay required when buying
                    actual cryptos. However, trading CFDs comes with a high risk of losing money
                    rapidly due to leverage.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Trade on a secure platform.</strong> You can utilise measures such as
                    the two-factor authentication (2FA) to ensure you’re secure when trading online.

                    versa.</p>
                <h4 class="heading">Trading CFDs on cryptocurrencies: ether example</h4>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>After completing a thorough analysis on ether price movements, you believe the
                    market
                    will trend upwards from its current level of 3200. Consequently, you decide to
                    take
                    a long position using CFDs. Because you’re going long, you open your position by
                    electing to ‘buy’.</p>
                <p>In this example, after a spread of 8 points is applied – and excluding other
                    costs –
                    the buy (or offer) price is set at 3204, while the sell (or bid) price is 3196.
                    The
                    CFD you use specifies an amount of $1 per point of market movement, and you opt
                    to
                    trade 10 contracts. This brings your total exposure for the position to $32,040
                    ($3204 x $1 per point x 10 contracts).</p>
                <p>But, as positions on ether CFDs can be opened with a margin deposit of 50%,
                    you’ll
                    only need to deposit $15,020. At this point it’s important to note that because
                    your
                    exposure is larger than your required margin, you stand to lose more than the
                    deposit if the market moves against you. So, to manage your risk, you can set a
                    stop-loss to close your trade automatically.<sup>2</sup> In this case, suppose
                    you
                    add a guaranteed stop loss at 3000.</p>
                <p>The market moves as you predicted, up to a level of 3500, at which point you
                    decide
                    to close your position and take a profit. The sell (or bid) price after the
                    spread
                    is applied is 3496. The difference in price between 3496 and 3204 is 292 points.
                    This, excluding other costs, brings your profit on the trade to $2920 – a return
                    of
                    19.4% on your margin deposit.</p>

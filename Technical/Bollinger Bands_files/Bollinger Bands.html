				<p class="description">Bollinger Bands are the most popular trading indicator created by John Bollinger. These bands are commonly used to identify <strong>the Volatility of market</strong> and <strong>potential overbought or oversold</strong> areas.</p>
				<p>These bands help trader to see if price has extended far from the average market price. This indicates the trader that if the market is priced too High or too Low from an average price.</p>
				<p>Bollinger Bands consists of 3 lines.</p>

					<div class="img-title">Bollinger Band</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li> <span class="list_title">Middle band:</span> It is a continues Simple Moving Average(SMA) of the price. Commonly 20 period is used as length for SMA.</li>
						<li> <span class="list_title">Upper Band:</span> It is set 2 standard deviation away from Middle band. (i.e Middle band plus 2 standard deviation)</li>
						<li> <span class="list_title">Lower Band:</span> It is set 2 standard deviation below from Middle band. (i.e Middle band minus 2 standard deviation)</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				

				<p>Non technically, <strong>Standard deviation</strong> basically measures how far you are away from the average.</p>



				<br><br>
				<div class="list_title">How to use Bollinger Bands while trading:</div>
				<div>Please note that Bollinger Bands does not provide any Buy or Sell signal, it gives the information of the price that where it is standing.</div><p>There are multiple ways to use the moving average. Below are the few examples.</p>
				<br>

				<p></p>

				<div class="list_title">1. Finding the volatility of the market:</div>

				<div>In Bollinger bands, the Upper and Lower bands will contract and expand depending on the volatility of prices.</div>

				<p>Narrow bands indicate a market that is experiencing low volatility, that is markets moving in side-ways range</p>

				<p>Wide or widening bands will show that volatility is returning to the market, that is market is in trend</p>

				<p>Markets trend and markets range, from these price ranges we can get big moves as price begins to breakout from the compression.</p>

				<p>Narrow bands indicates that volatility is not present in the market. To enter the trade, We should look for signs that volatility to come back into the market as per below.</p>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li> Shortlist for the range/narrow market</li>
						<li> Mark the Upper band and Lower band line</li>
						<li> If price Breaks out these lines with a potential candle, then trade can be taken according to the price direction.</li>
						<li> Minimum take profit can be determined by any reversal pattern or pullback and also price crossing the upper or lower band accordingly</li>
						<li> Stop loss can be set slight above or below the breakout line.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					<div class="img-title">Bollinger Band example</div>
				</div>

				<p>In the above chart, Market touched Lower band 3 times and did not went up higher than the last range, causing the massive fall down.</p>







				<div class="list_title">2. Trading along with Upper and Lower Band:</div>
				<p>This is an easiest strategy that can be used to enter a trade. But can not be applicable every time. Works better when market is moving in any one particular trend.</p>
				<div>As we know that Middle band is a 20 period SMA and acts as a intermediate trend.</div>
				<p>When the market is moving in one direction or Trend, we can use Upper and Lower band as a price reversal point.</p>

				<p>Please note that this strategy might give a wrong signals too. So please use this strategy for Long term Trading or Higher time frame</p>

					<div class="img-title">Bollinger Band reversal strategy</div>
				</div>

				<p>Below are few points that we need to observe in the market while using this strategy:</p>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li> Market should be in Bullish or Bearish trend or longer Side-ways</li>
						<li> Shortlist the market that price started reversing near Upper or Lower Band</li>
						<li> Enter into trade, if you found any <strong>price reversal sign or pattern or pullback or reversal breakout</strong> at or near the upper/lower bands. There is a High probability that price might go reversal.</li>
						<li> Price reversal pattern could be Hammer, Engulfing, Harami, Morning star etc.</li>
						<li> Please note that, here Lower and Upper bands might be acting as a Support and Resistance line, but actually they are not.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="list_title">3. Using Multiple Time-Frame:</div>
				<div class="imgs">
					<img src="https://panthitech.github.io/forexcandlestick/Technical/Bollinger Bands_files/bb_exp.PNG">
					<div class="img-title">Multiple Time-Frame strategy</div>
				</div>
				<p>In the above image, the Daily chart looks Bullish, but for the 3rd candle, if we look into the lower time frame, there is a red candle later on green candle with a Hammer candle pattern.</p>

				<p>From this we can assume that </p>

				<ul>
					<li> Market is Bullish in higher time frame</li>
					<li> Price making reversal pattern in the lower time frame</li>
					<li> So, trade can be taken based on lower time frame</li>
					<li> This helps trader to enter into the market at exact price</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Below chart shows example for the same</p>

				<div class="imgs">
					<img src="https://panthitech.github.io/forexcandlestick/Technical/Bollinger Bands_files/bb6.PNG">
					<div class="img-title">30-min Time Frame</div>
				</div>

				<div class="imgs" >
					<img src="https://panthitech.github.io/forexcandlestick/Technical/Bollinger Bands_files/bb5.PNG">
					<div class="img-title">5-Min Time Frame</div>
				</div>

				<ul>
					<li> Market formed Double bottom pattern near Lower band in 30-Min frame</li>
					<li> By this, we can expect a price reversal and a Bullish trend.</li>
					<li> To enter a trade, we can make use of lower time frame</li>
					<li> Now observe the 5-Min frame, after double bottom we had multiple opportunities to enter trade</li>
					<li> One is Hammer pattern near mid band</li>
					<li> Second is price breaking out at Upper band</li>
				</ul>


				<br>
				<br>
				
				<div>
					<div class="list_title">Timeframe:</div>
					<ul>
						<li> Applicable to all Time-frame</li>
						<li> Bollinger Bands work better with multiple Timeframe applied for the same market</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					<div class="list_title">Pros and Cons of using MACD</div>

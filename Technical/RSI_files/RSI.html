				<p class="description">The RSI stands for Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used momentum indicator oscillator by many traders.</p>

				<p>The RSI compares the strength of up days(gain) to the strength of down days(loss) and with that calculation, we can determine if the momentum taking place is either bullish or bearish. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and the purpose is to measure the “speed” of a price movement.</p>

				<p>If price goes up faster, RSI value will be higher and if price falls down faster, RSI value will be lower</p>

				</div>

				<p>The most common settings that traders usually use are:</p>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="list_title"> 14-Period RSI</span> - The average gain or loss will be based on the last 14 candles</li>
						<li><span class="list_title"> 70 and 30</span> - Where 70 is overbought and 30 is oversold level</li>
						<li><span class="list_title"> 80 and 20</span> - Where 80 is overbought and 20 is oversold level</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					<div class="img-title">RSI 70:30 Zone</div>
				</div>

				<p>Here 70 or 80 level is considered bullish, while 30 or 20 level is an indication of bearishness. It helps to measure periods of overbought or oversold conditions.</p>

				<p>Using RSI, help traders to predict rising momentum, demand or supply, market trends such as trend reversals and trend continuations.</p>

				<p>With a proper practices and with the help of price action, volume and RSI, a trader can make a great price prediction.</p>


				



				<br><br>
				<div class="list_title">How to use RSI:</div>
				<div>Below are the commonly used methods of using RSI indicator.</div>
				<br>

				<div class="list_title">1. Overbought and Oversold</div>
				<div>Using RSI, we can easily find out the markets that are Over valued or Over sold. As already mentioned, markets above 70 or 80 RSI can be considered as overbought and we can expect a price reversal i.e Bearish from that level. Also, most of the time market makes a strong Bullish move above RSI-70</div>

				<p>Similarly, markets below 30 or 20 RSI can be considered as oversold and we can expect a price reversal i.e Bullish from that level. Also, most the time market makes a strong Bearish move below RSI-30</p>

					<div class="img-title">Overbought and Oversold</div>
				</div>

				<br>

				<p><span class="list_title">Note: </span>Please note that the above method is not a trading strategy and trade can not be taken based on level reach. Most of the time you will lose trade expecting a reversal at those level. A <strong>Highly Trend</strong> market starts pumping/dumping( a highly sudden changes in the price with in a short time) after market moves above/below of those levels.</p>

				<p>Always use this method to get a confirmation while using other indicator/strategy</p>

				<div class="list_title">2. Determination Of Trend</div>

				<div> Using RSI, we can determine the current status of the Market's trend. Below are few market trend behavior based on RSI level.</div>
				<div class="imgs">
					<img src="https://panthitech.github.io/forexcandlestick/Technical/RSI_files/rsi3.PNG">
					<div class="img-title">RSI Trend</div>
				</div>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>  In a Bull market RSI value tends to travel in between 40-80 level zones.</li>
						<li> In a Bear Market RSI value tends to travel in between 60-20 level zones.</li>
						<li> In Sideways market RSI Value stay in between 40-65 zones.</li>
						<li> In extreme or very strong Bull market RSI bound in 60-90 levels.</li>
						<li> In extreme or very strong Bear market RSI bound in 40-10 levels.</li>
						<li> Value above 95 and below 5 are very rare. As above or below this this level RSI behave logarithmically means change in RS is very minute to notice</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<br><br>

				<div class="list_title">3. Pattern based RSI</div>
				<div>To know more about the Patterns, please go through the different Pattern structures and its usages available in this App.</div>

				<p>As we already know that to apply multiple pattern structure on candle stick charts and using breakout strategy to Trade. In the similar way, we can also apply patters on RSI too. Isn't its interesting</p>

				<p>M, W, Flag, Triangles, Wedges, Head and Shoulder and othere patters can be applied on RSI, as shown in below examples. Please note that all the <strong>Rules remains same</strong> for the breakout of these patterns.</p>

				<div class="list_title">4. RSI Divergence strategy</div>

				
				<div>Non technically, Divergence cab be defined as whenever there is a misunderstanding between price and indicator, they used to get divert from each other and moved in opposite direction to each other.</div>

				<div class="imgs">
					<img src="https://panthitech.github.io/forexcandlestick/Technical/RSI_files/rsi11.PNG">
					<div class="img-title">Dynamic Support and Resistance example</div>
				</div>

				<p>There are 3 types of divergence</p>

				<p><strong>1. Simple Divergence</strong></p>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>  Whenever price makes a lower low and RSI makes higher low then it is said to be Simple Bullish Divergence.</li>
						<li>  Simple Bullish Divergence occur in bear market, commonly known as short covering.</li>
						<li>  A simple bullish divergence is more reliable when RSI value lies between 40 to 10.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="imgs">
					<img src="https://panthitech.github.io/forexcandlestick/Technical/RSI_files/rsi9.PNG">
					<div class="img-title">Divergence example</div>
				</div>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>  Whenever price makes a higher high and RSI makes lower high then it is said to be Simple Bearish Divergence.</li>
						<li>  Simple Bearish Divergence occur in bull market, commonly known as retracement or correction.</li>
						<li>  A simple bearish divergence is more reliable when RSI value lies between 80 to 65.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				

				<p><strong>Please Note</strong> that if Lesser the number of candles between 2 peaks more powerful will be reversal in terms of price n time both.</p>

				<br><br>

					


				<p><strong>2. Hidden Divergence</strong></p>

				<div class="imgs">
					<img src="https://panthitech.github.io/forexcandlestick/Technical/RSI_files/rsi12.PNG">
					<div class="img-title">Hidden Divergence</div>
				</div>

				<p>If you notice, both Simple and Hidden divergence are same, but only changes are in Price and RSI making Higher high and Lower high.</p>

				<p>Hidden divergence mostly occur between 40 to 65 level as RSI value</p>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>  Whenever RSI makes a <strong>Higher high</strong> &amp; price makes a <strong>Lower high</strong> then it is said to be Bearish Hidden Divergence.</li>
						<li>  A bearish hidden divergence is strongest when it occur near 65 level with M or double top pattern.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>	

				<div class="imgs">
					<img src="https://panthitech.github.io/forexcandlestick/Technical/RSI_files/rsi7.PNG">
					<div class="img-title">RSI Hidden Divergence</div>
				</div>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>  Whenever RSI makes a <strong>Lower low</strong> &amp; price makes a <strong>Higher low</strong> then it is said to be Bullish Hidden Divergence.</li>
						<li>  A bullish hidden divergence is strongest when it occur near 40 level with W or double bottom pattern.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p> Usually highest volume is witness in reversal candle as compared to last 5-8 candles near its resistance at 65 or support at 40 in RSI.</p>

				<br><br>

					


				<p><strong>3. Multiple or Long Divergence</strong></p>
				<p>If you notice, both Simple and Hidden divergence are same, but only changes are in Price and RSI making Higher high and Lower high.</p>

				<p>Hidden divergence mostly occur between 40 to 65 level as RSI value</p>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>  Whenever price makes a series of lower low n RSI makes a series of higher low it known to be Multiple Simple Bullish Divergence</li>
						<li>  Whenever RSI makes a series of lower low n Price makes a series of higher low it is known to be Multiple Hidden Bullish Divergence.</li>
						<li> Multiple Bullish Divergence are more reliable when RSI value lies between 40-10 along with triple bottom, falling wedge, H&amp;S formation formed either in RSI or in price.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="imgs">
					<img src="https://panthitech.github.io/forexcandlestick/Technical/RSI_files/rsi10.PNG">
					<div class="img-title">Long Divergence</div>
				</div>	

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>  Whenever price makers a series of higher high n RSI makes a series of lower high it is known to be Multiple Simple Bearish Divergence.</li>
						<li>  Whenever RSI makes a series of Higher high n Price makes a series of lower high it is known to be Multiple Hidden Bearish Divergence.</li>
						<li> Multiple Bearish Divergence are more reliable when RSI value lies between 65-80 along with triple top, rising wedge, H&amp;S formation formed wither in RSI or in price.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>Multiple hidden divergence are more reliable when RSI value lies between 40-65 along with spring, triangle, flag or combination of three is formed either in Price or RSI. Multiple Divergence are the strongest &amp; most reliable trend reversal signal Valid for all time-frame.</p>

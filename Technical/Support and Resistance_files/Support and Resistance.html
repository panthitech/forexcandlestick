				<p>One can become a pro trader if they have highly knowledge on <strong>RSI, candlestick patterns, Support and Resistance levels with Price Action.</strong></p>
				<p class="description">All the technical indicators that we have today are derivatives of price and cannot give you more meaningful information than price alone.</p>

				<p>In order to read the price information correctly, we should understand the concept of support and resistance.</p>

					<div class="img-title">Support and Resistance</div>
				</div>

				<p>We can find some levels from where the direction of the market starts to reverse its trend, those levels are known as <strong>Support and Resistance</strong> levels.</p>

				<p>Support is a price area on a chart, where <strong>demand</strong> is located</p>

				<p>Resistance is a price area, where <strong>supply</strong> is located</p>

					<div class="img-title">Supply and Demand</div>
				</div>

				<p>In simple terms, Demand is a zone in which Buyers are more interested to buy the stocks and Supply is a zone in which Sellers are waiting to liquidate their holdings.</p>

				<p>These levels forms a trend line called Support and Resistance. Using support and resistance, we can predict the price movement and direction any market</p>

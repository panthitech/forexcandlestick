				<h2 class="sub_title">Moving Average</h2>
				<p class="description">Moving averages are the average prices of the past 'x' number of periods. These can help to form the Support and Resistance for the price action</p>
				<p>Moving average are frequently used technical indicator. It reduces the price fluctuations or noise. It filters small fluctuations in the price so the viewer can see the price movement without much fluctuations and noise on the chart.</p>
				<p>Moving Averages are the lagging indicators, which means they do not predict where price is going, they are only providing data on where price has been.</p>
				<p>There are multiple types of moving averages. Most popular and commonly used moving averages are as follows</p>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="list_title"> SMA</span> - Simple Moving Average</li>
						<li><span class="list_title"> EMA</span> - Exponential Moving Average</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="img-title">Fig-1: Moving average example</div>
				</div>



				<div class="list_title">SMA - Simple Moving Average:</div>
				<div>A simple moving average (SMA) are the continues average of a selected range of prices, usually closing prices, by the number of periods in that range.</div>

				<br>

				<div class="list_title">EMA - Exponential Moving Average:</div>
				<div>EMA are similar to SMA but these are exponentially weighted moving averages. They places a greater weight and significance on the price of the most recent data points. It reacts quicker to the changes in the price movements than the SMA.</div>

				<p><span class="list_title">Note: </span> Few markets works good with SMA but not on EMA, and again few works properly with EMA and not with SMA.</p>

				<p>Fig-2 and Fig-3 represents SMA and EMA respectively. Both looks similar. But if you look at closely EMA is more attached than SMA to the price movements</p>

				<br>


				<p class="list_title">Difference between SMA and EMA</p>
				<div>There is really only one difference when it comes to EMA vs. SMA and itâ€™s speed. The EMA moves much faster and it changes its direction earlier than the SMA.</div>
				<p class="list_title">SMA</p>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li> Slow moving and smoother average indicator. Reacts slowly to price movements</li>
						<li> Eliminates most of the fake-outs( False price breakouts)</li>
						<li> More lag than the EMA</li>
						<li> Acts as support and resistance for most of the markets</li>
						<li> Suitable for Mid-term to Long-term trading</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p class="list_title">EMA</p>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li> Quick moving and sensitive to recent price movements. Reacts faster</li>
						<li> More prone to fake-outs</li>
						<li> Less lag than SMA</li>
						<li> Acts as support and resistance for volatile markets</li>
						<li> Suitable for Short-term to Mid-term trading</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="list_title">Moving average periods:</div>

				<p>Based on traders comfortability, the length and period can be set to any of the Moving average(i.e SMA, EMA or other) indicator. For slow moving average a longer periods are preferred and for fast moving average a shorter periods are preferred as follows</p>

				<p><span class="list_title">7 to 10 period: </span> It is a very popular and extremely fast moving average. Often used as a directional filter. Very useful for short term trade, Future and Option trading.</p>

				<p><span class="list_title">20 to 25 period: </span> It is a Medium-term and the most accurate moving average. Most of the time this shows the exact price movement. Good when it comes to riding trends.</p>

				<p><span class="list_title">50 period: </span> It is a Medium-term moving average and in a volatile and trend market, it is best suited for identifying the mid-term reversal and direction.</p>

				<p><span class="list_title">100 period: </span> It is Long-term moving average. Can be used for the direction of the market.</p>

				<p><span class="list_title">200 period: </span> This is commonly used long-term moving average which acts as Support and Resistance for most of the stocks. This is also used as trend indicator, in which the current price above 200 period moving average line then can be considered as market is Bullish and price goes below the line as Bearish</p>

				<br>

				<p><span class="list_title">Note: </span> It is not mandatory to use multiple periods, cross overs to enter the trade. It's up-to you that how much you are comfortable at using a Moving average to take a decision. A good trader always wait for the opportunity to enter into the trade at right time.</p>


				<br><br>
				<div class="list_title">How to use Moving Averages:</div>
				<p>There are multiple ways to use the moving average. Below are the few examples. Please note that all the bellow examples applies to most of the different types of Moving averages(i.e SAM, EMA and others)</p>
				<br>

				<div class="list_title">1. Cross-over strategy</div>
				<p>This is the easiest strategy. If fast moving MA crosses above slow moving MA, then market can be considered as Bullish. In the same way, fast moving MA crosses below slow moving MA, then it can be considered as Bearish. For this, need at least 2 Moving periods.</p>

				<div class="imgs">
					<img src="https://panthitech.github.io/forexcandlestick/Technical/SMA_files/sma6.PNG">
					<div class="img-title">MA Cross over</div>
				</div>

				<p>Another method is, If last price crosses above any MA line, then market can be considered as Bullish. If last price crosses below any MA line, then market can be considered as Bearish.</p>

				<br>
				<br>

				<div class="list_title">2. The Golden Cross and the Death Cross Strategies</div>
				<p>The <span class="list_title">Golden Cross</span> is a bullish signal when the 50 period moving average crosses above the 200 period moving average. When the market is in a long-term downtrend, the 50-day moving average is below the 200-day moving average. When a new uptrend begins, the 50 period moving average crosses above the 200 moving average. This cross over is called as Golden Cross Strategy.</p>
				<p>The <span class="list_title">Death Cross</span> is a bearish signal when the 50 period moving average crosses below the 200 period moving average. It is exactly opposite to the Golden cross strategy</p>

					<div class="img-title">Golden Cross and the Death Cross example</div>
				</div>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li> It works properly in trend and volatile market</li>
						<li> It is a Lag indicator, you might miss out the exact entry of the trade</li>
						<li> Usually preferred for long term trading</li>
						<li> Gives falls signals in Side ways market</li>
						<li> Use multiple indicator to enter the trade</li>
						<li> Stop loss can be set by Trend line or Lowest price of the previous candles</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<br><br>

				<div class="list_title">3. Dynamic Support and Resistance Strategies</div>
				<p>As we know that Support and Resistance can be set as Horizontal lines, Diagonal lines and by Trend lines. In the same way, Moving Averages also acts as Dynamic support and resistance.</p>

				<p>Dynamic support and resistance levels are constantly changing and moving with the price. When price dips and tests the moving average or touches the moving average line, trader can take a action of Buy or Sell, but not every time it touches. Fig.3 is an example for that.</p>

				<p>Trade can taken based on price support and resistance, or according to its breakout of that line</p>

					<div class="img-title">Dynamic Support and Resistance example</div>
				</div>

				<div>
					<ul>
						<li> It works well with Elliott wave pattern theory(Advanced Trading)</li>
						<li> Most of the traders use this for Scalping (Advanced trading)</li>
						<li> Since 90% people use moving average with period 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 while trading, all gonna expect the price movement according to the moving average line. So we can consider its level as a dynamic Support and Resistance.</li>
						<li> Dynamic support and resistance are not as strong as Horizontal and Diagonal support and resistance</li>
						<li> Can be used as level check</li>
						<li> Encounters with falls breakout</li>
						<li> Applicable to multiple time frame</li>
					</ul>
				</div>


				<br>
				
				<div>
					<div class="list_title">Timeframe:</div>
					<ul>
						<li>Applies to all timeframe</li>
						<li>Moving Averages work better if applied on multiple timeframe for the same market</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					<div class="list_title">Pros and Cons of using Moving Averages</div>
					<p>PROS</p>
					<ul>
						<li> Acts as Support and Resistance</li>
						<li> Used to determine the trend</li>
						<li> Most of the traders use Moving average, so we can take advantage of that</li>
					</ul>
					<p>CONS</p>
					<ul>
						<li> Its a lag indicator. Signals or cross over happens after price movements. Opportunities can be missed out</li>
						<li> Better to use trend lines or another indicators</li>
					</ul>

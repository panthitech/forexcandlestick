        <h2 class="sub_title">Triangle pattern</h2>
        <p class="description">A Triangle pattern is a consolidation pattern that occurs at mid-trend and usually signals a continuation of the existing trend. The triangle chart pattern is formed by drawing two converging trendlines as price temporarily moves in a sideways direction. On subsequent breakout, in the direction of the preceding trend, a trade can be done</p>

      </div>

	      <p class="description">A triangle pattern forms when a stockâ€™s trading range narrows following an uptrend or downtrend, usually indicating a consolidation, accumulation, or distribution before a continuation or reversal.</p>

			<br>
	      <p>There are three types in Triangle pattern</p>

	      

	      <div class="list_title">1. Ascending Triangle:</div>
		<div class="imgs">
	        <img src="file:///android_asset/Breakout/triangle_files/accending_triangle.PNG">
	        <div class="img-title">Ascending Triangle</div>
	      </div>
	      <p></p>
	      <p>The ascending triangle is formed in an uptrend and indicates a continuation of the uptrend.</p>
	      <p>It is formed as a right-angled triangle with a resistance and a slope of higher lows.</p>
	      <p>The upper trendline(resistance line) is flat and the lower trendline(support line) is rising</p>
	      <p>The resistance does not allow the prices of the securities to move more upward. The higher lows show that the buying pressure has increased.</p>
	      <p>This pattern indicates that buyers are more aggressive than sellers as price continues to make higher lows.</p>
	      <p>This pattern clearly indicates that the market moves higher as the higher lows are formed heading toward the resistance line.</p>
	      <p>The breakout of the prices is confirmed when the prices break from the resistance level with volume and continue to move upwards.</p>

	      <br><br>
	      <div class="list_title">2. Descending Triangle:</div>
		<div class="imgs">
	        <img src="file:///android_asset/Breakout/triangle_files/bear_triangle.PNG">
	        <div class="img-title">Descending Triangle</div>
	      </div>
	      <p>The descending triangle is formed in the downtrend and indicates the continuation of the downtrend.</p>
	      <p>It is formed as a downward sloping triangle with support and a slope of lower highs.</p>
	      <p>The lower trendline(support line) is flat and the upper trendline(resistance line) is falling.</p>
	      <p>The support does not allow the prices of the securities to move more downward.</p>
	      <p>The lower highs show that the selling pressure has increased.</p>
	      <p>This pattern indicates that sellers are more aggressive than buyers as price continues to make lower highs.</p>
	      <p>This pattern clearly indicates that the market moving lower as the lower highs are formed heading toward the support line.</p>
	      <p>This indicates the strength of bears and they are willing to sell more for the stock.</p>
	      <p>The breakout of the prices is confirmed when the prices break from the support level with volume and continue to move down.</p>

	       <div class="list_title">3. Symmetrical Triangle:</div>

	        <img src="file:///android_asset/Breakout/triangle_files/bull_symetricle_triangle.PNG">
	        <div class="img-title">Bullish Symmetrical Triangle</div>
	      </div>

	      <div class="imgs">
	        <img src="file:///android_asset/Breakout/triangle_files/bear_symetricale_triangle.PNG">
	        <div class="img-title">Bearish Symmetrical Triangle</div>
	      </div>
	      <p>A symmetrical triangle occurs when the price is making lower highs and higher lows.</p>
	      <p>Symmetrical triangle pattern is considered to be indecisive meaning that while the market is stuck within, the directional bias is unknown.</p>
	      <p>This means that neither the buyers nor the sellers are able to gain control, causing the price to range within a triangle.</p>
	      <p>Only the breakout of a boundary of a triangle clarifies the future price direction.</p>
	      <p>The price usually trades between trend lines which act as support and resistance. As the price breaks the support/resistance line of the triangle, trade can be taken based on the breakout direction.</p>

	      <p><strong>Trading Psycology:</strong> Bulls (buyers) &amp; bears (sellers) are fighting. As the fight intensifies, uncertainty increases and volume decreases, as the range of prices start narrowing. Once a breakout occurs, price and volume tends to spike, as all the buyers or sellers waiting on the sidelines start making their move.</p>

        	<div class="list_title">How to trade Ascending/Descending Triangle:</div>
	        <ul>
			  <li>For Ascending triangle: Identify the triangle structure having a flat Resistance and a rising Support Trendline moving Sideways</li>
			  <li>For Descending triangle: Identify the triangle structure having a flat Support and a rising Resistance Trendline moving Sideways</li>
			  <li>Draw a trend line on a series of Highs followed by a series of Lows. This froms a Support and Resistance line</li>
			  <li>Wait for the Breakout of Support/Resistance of the triangle respectively</li>
			  <li>If the close price crosses the Support/Resistance line with a big candlesticks, This confirm the breakout</li>
			  <li>Increase in volume near the Support/Resistance line determines the perfect breakout</li>

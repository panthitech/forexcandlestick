        <h3 class="list_title">How to use Trading Charts on
            TradingView</h3>
        <p class="m-text-1"> Charts are one of the
            platform’s most valued aspects. Once you
            select your preferred TradingView chart
            type, you can add tailored TradingView
            indicators – like the ability to save
            templates of your favorite TradingView
            indicators and customize your chart's
            appearance. Let’s take a closer look at how
            these options can be adjusted to suit your
            individual trading needs through the
            following steps: </p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="m-title-3 mb-3">1. Select
            your Trading Instruments</h3>
        <p class="m-text-1"> First, you’ll
            need to load the instrument you
            are interested in looking at. To
            do this, head to the Navigation
            Bar at the top, specifically the
            “Products” drop-down menu and
            select the “Supercharts” option.
            Then, to your very right, click
            on the “Watchlist, details, and
            news” icon at the top right
            corner to reveal the Watchlist.
            Here, you can see a selection of
            instruments offered by
            easyMarkets on TradingView.
            Select your preferred Index,
            Stock, Commodity, Metal, Forex,
            or Crypto. </p>

        <h3 class="m-title-3 mb-3">2.
            Add a Comparison</h3>
        <p class="m-text-1"> Once you've
            selected your preferred
            instrument as described, you can
            compare your chosen asset with
            another like the S&amp;P 500.
            Simply click on the plus symbol
            next to the currently loaded
            instrument pair. This comparison
            feature is incredibly useful for
            traders trying to get a sense of
            how their selected asset stacks
            up against broader market trends
            or other competing assets. It
            offers a broader perspective,
            helping to identify correlations
            or divergences that might not be
            apparent through
            single-instrument analysis.</p>

        <h3 class="m-title-3 mb-3">3.
            Choose a Timeframe</h3>
        <p class="m-text-1">Depending on
            your trading strategy,
            especially if you favor timeframe
            trading, you may need to
            see your chart in different
            reference timeframes. Right
            beside the instrument pair,
            along with the plus symbol,
            you'll notice either a single
            letter or a combination of
            letters and numbers. These
            symbols are your key to
            selecting different time periods
            - for example: 1 hour, 1 day, or
            1 month, among others. Adjusting
            the timeframe to match your
            strategy is crucial, as it
            allows for a tailored analysis
            based on the specific intervals
            you're interested in monitoring.</p>

            Select a Chart Type</h3>
        <p class="m-text-1">Choosing the
            right chart type on TradingView
            is a subject of much debate
            among traders, but ultimately,
            the choice comes down to
            personal preference. TradingView
            recognizes this by offering a
            diverse range of chart types to
            align with various trading
            styles and analysis techniques.
            From the classic bar and
            candlestick charts to more
            specialized options like Heikin
            Ashi, Renko, and Kagi, each type
            provides a unique perspective on
            market movements. Whether you
            are drawn to the simplicity of
            line charts or the detailed
            analysis that hollow candles can
            offer, TradingView caters to all
            preferences, ensuring traders
            have all the tools they need to
            trade the way they prefer. </p>

            Indicators</h3>
        <p class="m-text-1">Adding TradingView
            indicators to your charts
            amplifies your ability to
            analyze market trends and make
            informed decisions. TradingView
            offers a seamless process to
            integrate various indicators,
            catering to a wide range of
            analytical needs. Renowned tools
            like Fibonacci levels, Bollinger
            Bands, the Relative Strength
            Index (RSI), and the Simple
            Moving Average (SMA) are readily
            available. These indicators,
            among others, provide insights
            into market movements,
            volatility, momentum, and trend
            directions. By customizing your
            TradingView chart with these
            indicators, you can
            comprehensively analyze data,
            enhancing your trading strategy

            Save your Indicator
            Template</h3>
        <p class="m-text-1">If your trading
            strategy involves a personalized
            selection of indicators,
            TradingView charts offer the
            functionality to save these as a
            template. This TradingView
            feature allows for quick access
            to your preferred setup without
            the need to recreate it each
            time you analyze different
            instruments or timeframes.
            Moreover, there's a community
            aspect where traders can share
            your customized templates with
            others or explore templates
            created by fellow traders. This
            exchange of resources can be
            incredibly beneficial, providing
            new perspectives or strategies
            you might not have considered.
            Embracing this template-sharing
            culture enriches your trading
            experience, offering insights
            and saving time across various

        <p class="m-text-1">Traders can
            also completely customize the
            appearance of your chart. In the
            upper right corner, click on the

            appear. In this window, you have

            scales, appearance, trading, and
            events. This TradingView feature
            can help you better analyze the
            chart you are looking at or
            better label a trade idea when
            sharing. You can also access
            chart customization by

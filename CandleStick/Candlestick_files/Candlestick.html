				<p>A candlestick chart represents the price movement of a stock market over a certain time period. These are formed by OHLC (Open, High, Low and Close) price of the market.</p>

					<div class="img-title">Fig1: Japanese Candlestick</div>
				</div>
				<p class="description">Japanese Candlesticks are broken down into two main parts, the body and the wick( also called as shadow). These parts meet in a style that looks like a candle, thus the name of the chart style as Candlestick.</p>

				<div class="list_title">Wicks or Shadows</div>
				<div class="imgs">

					<div class="img-title">Fig1: Wicks or Shadows</div>
				</div>
				<div>Thin line at the top and bottom of the candle body, shows the highest and lowest prices traded over the time frame forms the Wicks</div>

				<p>A candle with a short or no wick means that price action was strong in to the close and either buyers, represented with a green candlestick, or sellers, represented with a red candlestick, were in control for the entire time period.</p>

				<p>If the wicks are long, then there was a large range of prices traded and buyers and sellers were both in control.</p>
				<br>

					<div class="img-title">Fig1: Candlestick Body and Wick by size</div>
				</div>

				<div class="list_title">Body</div>
				<div>The thicker middle portion, shows the open and closing prices during the time frame forms the Body of the candlestick</div>

					<p></p>
					<div class="img-title">Fig1: Candlestick body</div>
				</div>

				<p>The size of the body indicates the intensity of buying or selling. The longer the body, the more price moved over the time period of that candlestick.</p>

				<p>A short body means that the opening and closing prices were very similar, meaning that there was not much strength to price action.</p>



				<br>
				<p><span class="list_title">Note: </span>It is not mandatory to be the color of Bullish candle as Green and Bearish candle as Red. You can change it to your personal choice.</p>
				<br>

				<p>Based on Open and Close price, candles can be distinguished in 2 types</p>

				<p class="list_title">1. Bullish Candle</p>

				<div>These Bullish candles are formed when the market price <strong>Closes above the Open</strong> price over a particular time period.</div>
